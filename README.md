# automate-tinder

I watched an introductory video about OOP in python and thought of applying it to something fun. 

So I tried to automate tinder lol...

 I watched the videos and understood the ideas behind them first, then I coded on my own. Please feel free to take a look and comment on how I can improve on my code :-)
 
 Note: I requires the following
 1) chromedriver (download link: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/)
 2) selenium (install via your computer's terminal)
